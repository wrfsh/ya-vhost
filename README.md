## Keeping in sync with arcadia
This repository's BB master branch is currently being kept in sync with
arcadia's trunk. Thus, whenever there is a new pull request being merged into
master it is the author's responsibility to make sure it gets synchronized with
arcadia and makes its way into trunk. This includes passing all the necessary
CI checks as well as getting reviewed by the NBS/core teams.

Read more on how to synchronize your changes [here](scripts/README.md).
